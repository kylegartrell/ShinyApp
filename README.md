Using Shiny and Slidify

You will find the presentation slides in the ShinyApp Folder.
If you click on the index.md the slides will appear, however, not as a presentation.  They will show as one page, however, if you are familiar with slidify (I am not) you will notice I have the code in there for 5 slides. I failed to push the slides using git in the command window.  It would not accept my password.  I apologize for the inconvience.
